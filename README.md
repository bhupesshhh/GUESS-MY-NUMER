I used random module, while and nested loops to make this game.

In this game, Computer chooses a random number and we have to guess the correct answer. Computer gives responses compare to our guesses.

If guess is less than correct answer, Computer replies with "too low"
If guess is more than correct answer, Computer replies with "too high"
If your guess is correct, COmputer detects it and shows the right answer.
